<h2 dir="ltr">Smart Grid&rsquo;s Language Problem</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The vocabulary and language of the smart grid is a problem even for seasoned experts. Teams speak about the same terms and often miscommunicate them as different objects and concepts. This makes cross-organizational discussions and assessments inefficient and frustrating.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Eliminating Communication Friction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">SEPA&rsquo;s Smart Grid Ontology addresses the frustration and inefficiency problem of smart grid communication head-on. This ontology contains a common set of architectural/business elements and categorical definitions that can be readily used, interpreted, understood, and modeled the same way across projects and organizations.</p>
